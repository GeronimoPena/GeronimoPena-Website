        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Geronimo Pena and I am 18 year old student at the University of California Riverside. My current major is Pre-Business, but the major that I will persue after my second year of college is business marketing. I consider myself to be a very goal oriented person who is also dedicated. Aside from being a full time student at UCR, I also maintain a job that allows me to financialy maintein myself while living in college. Over the last 3 years of life, I have been able to experience what having a formal job is like.
        <br><br>

        My first job ever was as a cashier at Jack in The Box in the city of Hemet. I was 15 years old and a sophomore in high school when I first began working at Jack in The Box in 2016. In my opinion, this was a perfect first job for me because I was able to maintain a 4.0GPA throught my 4 years of high school.The job consisted on taking orders, making food, and giving out the orders to the customers with the goal of making our customers happy. I would work close to 15 hours a week, while going to school in the mornings and playing soccer for a club team, which forced me to learn how to manage my time more efficiently and how to be more responsible. This job also taught many things such as; how to be rsposible with monney by counting all the money at the end of each shift, customer service by taking people's orders or attending them, teamwork by encouring us to communicate in order to work more efficientl, and many other valueable work skills that allowed me to increase my abilities to work. The reason why I stopped to work at Jack in The Box was because I moved away from my hometown for college which forced me to quit this job in 2019 after 2 and a half great years of working there. <br><br>

        Today, I am currently a server at Applebee's restaurant in Downtown Riverside. I was able to get this job in the first week of my freshman year of college, in September of 2019. This job is great for me at this time because I am able to be financially independent while living in college, although I still pay for my own college tuition. Applebee's has been a very work different experience so far since this job is more laid back and less stressful than my last job. As a server, my job is to take the order of the cutomers that come inside the restaurant to eat and make sure that all of their needs are satisfied while they eat their meal. Some of the skills that I had acquired in my past job allowed me to adapt to this new workplace very quickly.
